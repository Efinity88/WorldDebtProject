# WorldDebtProject
- In this project, I looked into the international debt data from the world bank where I found out different types of debt owed by differnt developing countries.
- This project was carried out on DataCamp.
- Data from the world Bank consisted of national and regional debt statistics for several countries from 1970 to 2015.
